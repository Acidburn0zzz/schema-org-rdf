# What is this space for?
This space is for collecting mappings to Schema.org terms from widely deployed Linked Data vocabularies, such as [in preparation](http://mappings.dbpedia.org/) by DBpedia, to be expected for top-level vocabularies such as [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/) or [FOAF](http://www.foaf-project.org/) or via 3rd party providers such as [schemapedia.com](http://schemapedia.com/).

# Are there IPR and license issues?
We understand that whoever contributes here, in the `mappings/*` folder, agrees to put the provided example into the Public Domain.
