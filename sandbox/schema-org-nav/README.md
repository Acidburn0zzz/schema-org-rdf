There are a number of Schema.org [extensions](http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/SchemaDotOrgProposals) proposed and partially already accepted. The tool you find here, the [Schema.org NavigatorJS](https://github.com/mhausenblas/schema-org-rdf/blob/master/sandbox/schema-org-nav/rdfa.html) allows to explore both the core terms of Schema.org and the extension terms, from within a Web browser.
